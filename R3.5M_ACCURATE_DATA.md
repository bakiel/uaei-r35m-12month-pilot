- **12 months** duration
- **15+ institutional buyers** (schools, hospitals, retailers)
- **50+ schools** in nutrition programs
- **10+ hospitals/clinics**

### Financial Impact
- **R2.5M+ farmer sales** facilitated through platform
- **R12,000/year** farmer income increase (+35% boost)
- **R85M Series A** target (24× multiplier from R3.5M)
- **R240M national economic impact** potential (at 10,000 farmer scale)

### Technology Validation (TRL 4 → 6)
- **99.5%+ platform uptime**
- **95%+ transaction accuracy**
- **80%+ farmer retention rate**
- **400+ videos produced** (33/month average)
- **50,000+ video views**
- **70%+ video completion rate**

### Job Creation
- **5 direct jobs** created (100% youth under 35)
- **100% new hires** (not existing staff)
- Technology-focused roles (developer, product, marketing, liaison, partnerships)

## THE PROBLEM (Crisis Stats)

### Market Exclusion
- **85% lack access to formal markets** (DAFF, 2023)
- **R2.4 billion annual post-harvest losses** due to poor market linkages

### Financial Exclusion
- **98% loan applications rejected** by banks (collateral-centric models)
- **100% previously unbanked** farmers in our target group
- **Zero digital tools** designed for rural, low-literacy farmers

### Social Crisis
- **65%+ youth unemployment** in rural agricultural communities
- **73% food insecurity** amongst producer households
- Farmers producing food but cannot afford to eat

## REVENUE MODEL (Post-Pilot)

### Farmer Subscriptions
- R50/month after free 12-month pilot
- 10,000 farmers × R50/month = **R6M ARR**

### Transaction Fees
- 2.5% of farmer sales (buyer pays, protects farmer margins)
- R200M annual sales × 2.5% = **R5M ARR**

### Institutional Licensing
- Provincial agriculture departments
- School nutrition program management systems
- R250k-R500k per province/year = **R3M ARR** (6 provinces)

**Total ARR at Scale: R14M**

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

### vs. R38M Proposal

- Shorter duration: 12 months vs. 18 months
- Smaller team: 5 people vs. 24 people
- Lower CAPEX: R1.84M vs. R15M
- Same technology validation (TRL 4 → 6)
- Same IP value creation potential
- More focused, efficient pilot

### Technology Focus (Not Operational Farming)
- Platform development = technology assets
- Content creation = educational technology
- AI/ML integration = advanced technology validation
- Payment gateway = complete transactional platform validation
- **NOT funding farming operations**
- **NOT funding land acquisition**
- **NOT funding crop production**
