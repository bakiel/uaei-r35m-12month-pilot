# R3.5M Pilot - Realistic Value Analysis

## INVESTMENT: R3,500,000

### What Gets Built (Tangible Assets):

**1. Content Creation Equipment: R150k**
- Professional video production gear
- Used to produce 400 videos
- Equipment retains ~60% value after 12 months = R90k resale value

**2. Technology Equipment: R731k**
- Mac workstations, displays, iPads
- Retains ~60% value after 12 months = R439k resale value
- Or continues in use for next phase

**3. Vehicle: R960k**
- Toyota Hilux 4×4
- Retains ~80% value after 12 months = R768k resale value
- Essential for ongoing operations

**4. Educational Content Library: 400 Videos**
- Production cost: R150k equipment + R180k marketing manager (content producer) = R330k
- Video production value if outsourced: 400 videos × R5,000 average = R2,000,000
- **Content Library Value: R2M** (realistic market rate for professional agricultural education content)

**5. Platform Code & Technology:**
- 12 months development (R387k developer + R546k product manager) = R933k investment
- Platform codebase value: Similar to investment ~R900k-R1M
- AI algorithms (using R160k APIs for training)
- Database architecture, UI/UX designs

**6. Validated Data & IP:**
- 100 farmer profiles with 12 months transaction data
- Proven AI credit scoring algorithm with real data
- Low-literacy interface patterns tested and refined
- Market data (what works, what doesn't)

### REALISTIC IP VALUE CREATED: R5-8M

**Breakdown:**
- Content library: R2M (400 professional videos)
- Platform codebase: R1M (functional, tested technology)
- Validated farmer data: R500k (100 farmers × 12 months insights)
- AI algorithms (trained on real data): R1M
- Proven business model: R1M (evidence it works = valuable)
- Design patterns & UX: R500k

**TOTAL CREATED VALUE: ~R6M**

### VALUE PROPOSITION FOR TIA:

**De-Risking R508.6M IDC Deployment:**
- R3.5M proves technology works BEFORE R508.6M investment
- **Value = Risk Mitigation**, not direct IP creation
- If technology fails, TIA saves IDC from R508.6M loss
- If technology succeeds, TIA enables R508.6M deployment

**ROI Perspective:**
- R3.5M investment
- Creates R6M in assets (1.7x return)
- But PRIMARY VALUE = de-risking R508.6M (145x potential deployment)
- **De-risking value >> Asset creation value**

### CORRECT MESSAGING:

❌ WRONG: "R3.5M creates R40-50M IP value" (unrealistic 11-14x)
✅ RIGHT: "R3.5M creates R6M in assets + de-risks R508.6M deployment" (realistic)

❌ WRONG: "14-43% ROI on IP creation"
✅ RIGHT: "Validates R508.6M viability | Creates R6M pilot assets"

### UPDATED HERO SLIDE:

**Strategic Value Box:**
- Amount: R6M (not R40-50M)
- Label: "Pilot Assets Created | De-Risks R508.6M IDC Deployment"
- Detail: "Content library + Platform code + Validated data"

### ECONOMIC LOGIC:

The value isn't in the R6M assets created by the pilot.
The value is in PROVING THE MODEL WORKS so R508.6M can deploy confidently.

**Think of it like:**
- R3.5M = Architectural model before building skyscraper
- R6M = Value of the model itself
- R508.6M = The actual skyscraper
- De-risking value = Avoiding R508.6M failure

### REALISTIC SUCCESS METRICS:

**After 12 months:**
- ✅ R6M in tangible assets (equipment, content, platform)
- ✅ Proof technology works with 100 farmers
- ✅ R2.5M in farmer sales facilitated (proves market exists)
- ✅ Data showing 80%+ farmer retention (proves value prop)
- ✅ Clear evidence for/against R508.6M deployment
- ✅ If successful: R508.6M IDC application ready
- ✅ If failed: Saved IDC from R508.6M loss

### BOTTOM LINE:

**R3.5M TIA Investment Returns:**
1. **Direct:** R6M in assets (1.7x)
2. **Primary:** De-risks R508.6M IDC decision (evidence-based, not speculative)
3. **Secondary:** If successful, enables R508.6M deployment (145x scale)

This is realistic, defensible, and makes sense.
